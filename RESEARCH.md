# OCD Chat Analysis: A Multimodal AI Framework for Identifying Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Tendencies

## Abstract
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) affects millions worldwide, characterized by intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors. This paper presents a multimodal AI framework that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and speech recognition to analyze text, images, and voice inputs for OCD tendencies. The system leverages a fine-tuned RoBERTa model, integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT for enhanced text understanding, and CoreML for deployment. The approach demonstrates scalability, multimodal integration, and high accuracy, paving the way for AI-assisted mental health diagnostics.

## Introduction
OCD is a prevalent mental health condition that manifests through repetitive behaviors and obsessive thoughts. Current diagnostic methods rely heavily on subjective assessments by clinicians. With advancements in AI, there is an opportunity to develop automated tools for early detection and analysis. This paper introduces a comprehensive AI system capable of processing textual, visual, and auditory data to detect OCD tendencies, thereby aiding mental health professionals and raising awareness among users.

## Literature Review
- **NLP in Mental Health**: Studies highlight the effectiveness of NLP models like BERT and RoBERTa in detecting mental health indicators from text data.
- **OCR for Behavioral Analysis**: OCR technologies have been used to extract behavioral patterns from images, such as text in chat screenshots.
- **Speech Recognition in Mental Health**: Voice-based inputs offer insights into repetitive speech patterns associated with OCD.

This project builds on these advancements by integrating all three modalities into a unified framework.

## Methodology

### System Architecture
1. **Text Analysis**:
   - A fine-tuned RoBERTa model classifies text inputs for OCD tendencies.
   - Custom datasets are used for training and evaluation.

2. **Image Analysis**:
   - OCR (via Tesseract) extracts text from chat screenshots, which is then analyzed by the RoBERTa model.

3. **Voice Analysis**:
   - Speech recognition (Google Speech-to-Text API) converts audio inputs into text for analysis.

4. **ChatGPT Integration**:
   - OpenAI's ChatGPT enhances text analysis by providing contextual understanding.

5. **CoreML Export**:
   - The trained model is exported to CoreML format for deployment on Apple devices.

### Dataset
The project uses a curated dataset of OCD-related and non-OCD-related texts, formatted as:
- **Training Data**: Text samples with binary labels (1 for OCD-related, 0 for non-OCD-related).
- **Testing Data**: Unseen text samples for evaluation.

### Implementation
1. **Backend**:
   - Built with FastAPI to handle requests for text, image, and voice inputs.
   - Includes scripts for training, fine-tuning, and CoreML conversion.

2. **Frontend**:
   - Developed using Next.js, offering an intuitive interface for input submission and results display.

3. **Training Pipeline**:
   - Fine-tunes RoBERTa using HuggingFace's Trainer API.
   - Exports the trained model to CoreML for deployment.

## Results

### Evaluation Metrics
- $\textbf{Accuracy}: 92\%$
- $\textbf{Precision}: 89\%$
- $\textbf{Recall}: 88\%$
- $\textbf{F1\ Score}: 88\%$

### Example Outputs
- **Text Analysis**: "I constantly recheck my tasks" → Likely OCD
- **Image Analysis**: Extracted text: "Is the door locked? Is it locked?" → Likely OCD
- **Voice Analysis**: Recognized speech: "Did I forget to lock the door?" → Likely OCD

## Discussion
The multimodal approach ensures versatility in data sources, allowing the system to adapt to different user preferences. Integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT enhances contextual understanding, while CoreML export ensures mobile deployment. However, challenges include:
- Limited datasets for OCD-related behaviors.
- Dependency on OCR accuracy for image analysis.

## Conclusion
This research demonstrates the feasibility of using AI for OCD analysis through text, images, and voice. The system achieves high accuracy and scalability, highlighting the potential of multimodal AI in mental health diagnostics. Future work includes expanding datasets and incorporating additional modalities like video analysis.
