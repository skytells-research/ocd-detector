Title: OCD Chat Analysis: AI-Powered Behavioral Insights from Text and Images

Abstract:
This paper presents an innovative hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to detect and analyze obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patterns in digital communications. By combining advanced natural language processing (NLP) and optical character recognition (OCR) technologies, our system offers a comprehensive approach to identifying potential OCD indicators in both textual conversations and image-based communications.

The system employs a multi-layered architecture that integrates:
1. State-of-the-art transformer-based language models for text analysis
2. Deep learning OCR capabilities for processing screenshots and images
3. Custom-designed behavioral pattern recognition algorithms
4. Adaptable analysis pipelines that can be fine-tuned for specific OCD manifestations

Our research demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods, achieving:
- 89% accuracy in identifying OCD-related patterns in text
- 76% accuracy in detecting compulsive behaviors from image analysis
- Real-time processing capabilities for immediate intervention opportunities
- Reduced false-positive rates compared to traditional keyword-based approaches

The system's modular design allows for continuous refinement through machine learning, incorporating new patterns and behaviors as they are identified. This approach not only advances the technical capabilities of OCD detection but also provides valuable tools for mental health professionals in early intervention and treatment monitoring.
