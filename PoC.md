# Proof of Concept (PoC)

## Overview
The OCD_Detector is a hybrid AI solution that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and voice analysis to identify OCD tendencies in textual, visual, and auditory inputs. This proof of concept demonstrates the ability to analyze inputs, fine-tune machine learning models, and integrate cutting-edge AI services like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

## Features
1. Text analysis for OCD tendencies using a fine-tuned RoBERTa model.
2. Chat screenshot analysis with OCR.
3. Voice-based input classification via microphone.
4. Integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT for enhanced understanding.
5. Ability to fine-tune models using custom datasets.
6. Export trained models to CoreML for deployment on Apple devices.

## Objectives
The PoC focuses on:
- Demonstrating the ability to classify OCD tendencies across multiple modalities.
- Validating the fine-tuning and training pipeline on real datasets.
- Showcasing integration with OpenAI and CoreML.
